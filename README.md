- 👋 Hi, I’m @adamrcarr
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning and deep learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning well what I had only learned quickly before.
- I'm building my portfolio during my summer vacation (now it's a wreck).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on stuff later. I'm really just happy to be doing something new.
- 📫 How to reach me @adamrcarr on twitter, or linked in available on my profile.
